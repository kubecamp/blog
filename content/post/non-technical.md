Yesterday I had the pleasure to visit the offices of [Tecknuovo](https://www.tecknuovo.com/). Tecknuovo is a DevOps recruitment agency who called me because they wanted to know more about Kubernetes.

Teaching kubernetes to a non technical audience is harder than it seems. Not only because kubernetes is a relative complex system, but because they are not familiar with many of the different components of the system. I have to say that it's as challenging as rewarding, as it forces you to find examples and similes that resonate with your audience.

The very first question that the guys of Tecknuovo asked me was **"Why Docker?"**, why all of a sudden, the industry has gone crazy about Docker, and how it relates to Config Management.

I will try to summarise in this post the experiences and what we learn during this session.
